# Stonecliff Village - Minecraft Vanilla Realm

Welcome to **Stonecliff Village**, a community-driven vanilla Minecraft realm! Below are the rules and guidelines for all players to follow to ensure a fun and fair experience.

## General Rules
1. **Respect All Players** – Treat everyone with kindness and respect. No harassment, bullying, or offensive language.
2. **No Griefing** – Do not destroy or modify others' builds without permission.
3. **No Cheating** – Hacked clients, x-ray packs, or game-altering mods (including item duplication) are strictly prohibited. Keep the gameplay fair and legitimate.
4. **No Stealing** – Do not take items or resources from other players' chests, builds, or farms without their explicit consent.
5. **Keep the Chat Friendly** – No inappropriate topics, spam, or excessive cursing. Keep the realm a family-friendly environment.
6. **PvP by Consent Only** – Player versus player combat is only allowed if all involved parties agree to it beforehand.
7. **No Exploiting Glitches** – Any bug or glitch exploitation (e.g., duplication glitches) is not allowed. Report bugs to staff immediately.

## Building and Environment
8. **Respect the Landscape** – Avoid excessive deforestation or destruction of natural areas near villages or player builds. Replant trees when possible.
9. **No Unclaimed Structures** – Mark your builds with signs, and do not leave unfinished or abandoned structures scattered across the world.
10. **Keep Your Builds Aesthetically Pleasing** – Try to maintain a theme that fits the realm's medieval/village aesthetic when building near the village hub or public areas.
11. **No Floating Trees** – When cutting down trees, make sure to fully remove them to avoid floating tree tops.
12. **Public Projects** – Large-scale or community builds must be approved by a staff member before construction begins.

## Community Etiquette
13. **Help New Players** – If you come across someone new, offer help and advice. It’s always appreciated.
14. **Shared Farms** – Respect communal resources and replant/replenish shared farms or resources if you take from them.
15. **Respect Player Space** – Don’t build too close to another player’s base unless you have their permission.
16. **Light Your Builds** – Prevent mob spawning near your builds by using adequate lighting (torches, lanterns, etc.).
17. **Coordinate Villager Trading** – If you're using the villager trading hall, make sure you leave it in good working order for the next person.

## Additional Guidelines
18. **No Wither Near Spawn** – Do not summon the Wither near spawn or in public areas. Choose a remote location to minimize damage.
19. **No AFK Machines** – Automatic AFK farms or machines that allow you to bypass the AFK kick feature are not allowed.
20. **End and Nether Etiquette** – Clean up after your journeys in the Nether and End. Make safe paths and avoid breaking important structures (like Ender Portals).

## Consequences
- **Warnings and Bans** – Repeated rule violations will result in warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from the realm, depending on the severity of the offense.

## Appeals Process
- **Appeals** – If you believe a punishment was unfair, you can make an appeal to the realm moderators. Keep it respectful and constructive.
